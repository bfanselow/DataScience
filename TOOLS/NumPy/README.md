# NumPy

### Fast mathematical computation on arrays/vectors and matrices

The Numpy module is mainly used for working with numerical data. It provides us with a powerful object known as an Array. With Arrays, we can perform mathematical operations on multiple values in the Arrays at the same time, and also perform operations between different Arrays, similar to matrix operations.
