# NumPy

### Fast mathematical computation on arrays/vectors and matrices

The **NumPy** module is mainly used for working with numerical data using (Numpy) *Array* objects. With Arrays, one can perform mathematical operations on multiple values in the Arrays at the same time, and also perform operations between different Arrays, similar to matrix operations.
