# Pandas

### Intuitive manipulation of Table data

The Pandas module is used for working with tabular data. It allows us to work with data in table form, such as in CSV or SQL database formats. We can also create tables of our own, and edit or add columns or rows to tables. Pandas provides us with some powerful objects like DataFrames and Series which are very useful for working with and analyzing data.
