# DataScience

### Collecting and "cleaning" gigantic quantities of (structured or unstructured) data to be processed by mathematical/statistical-analysis and machine-learning algorithms with the goal of extracting meaningful knowledge and insights (patterns, trends, predictions, etc.).

## Machine Learning Tools (Python)
### SciPy
 * NumPy 
 * Pandas   

**NumPy** and **Pandas** both provide fast and intuitive mathematical computation on arrays/vectors and matrices.

A **"vector"** is a list of one or more ordinary numbers. It can be thought of as a coordinate in an N-dimesional space. Mathematically this (Euclidean vector) represents line from the "origin" of that space to that coordinate where the origin is the zero-point of all dimensions.

Machine learning uses **"feature vectors"** which can be thought of as a specific location (i.e. coordinate) in a N-dimensional "feature" space, where N is the number of unique attributes/features.  A feature-vector then is simply an array of N unique features.

Typcially, one of the very first steps in making a machine learning model is "vectorizing" the data. Under the hood, machine-le
arning algorithms perform mathematical computations on vectors and collections-of-vectors (a.k.a. **matrix**).

Machine Leanrning computational terms
 * **Scalar**: A single number.
 * **Vector** : A list of values.(tensor of rank 1)
 * **Matrix**: A two dimensional list of values.(tensor or rank 2)
 * **Tensor**: A multi dimensional matrix with rank n.
